Following along with Brad learning more about TailwindCSS (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ)

Learned more about spacing things out and utilizing Tailwind's properties. Focused more on building mobile first and desktop second, learned how to create a custom hamburger menu that transforms using JavaScript. Had difficulty getting the hamburger menu to work, realized that every single div is incredibly important to recognize and not have too many. I feel like I always struggle with Tailwind getting it to work compared to Bootstrap, maybe I should try putting it in my head next time similar to Bootstrap instead of using the CLI. Overall was a great project!
